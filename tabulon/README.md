Tabulon is a Rust crate which ...

## Features

- `std` (enabled by default): Get floating point functions from the standard library
  (likely using your target's libc).
- `libm`: Use floating point implementations from [libm][].

At least one of `std` and `libm` is required; `std` overrides `libm`.

<!-- cargo-rdme end -->

As time has passed, some of Tabulon's dependencies could have released versions with a higher Rust requirement.
If you encounter a compilation issue due to a dependency and don't want to upgrade your Rust toolchain, then you could downgrade the dependency.

# Use the problematic dependency's name and version
cargo update -p package_name --precise 0.1.1
```
